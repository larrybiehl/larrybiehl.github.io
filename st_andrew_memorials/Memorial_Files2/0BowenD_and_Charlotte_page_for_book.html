font-family:"Georgia",serif;letter-spacing:.1pt'>Indianapolis - Charlotte R.
Bowen, aged 71, passed away on December 7, 2021 in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Charlotte was born on August 22, 1950, to James and Mildred Hixson in Oak
Ridge, Tennessee. After graduating from Franklin High School in 1968, she went
on to study Education at Purdue University. She married David L Bowen, deceased,
on June 10, 1972, in Johnson County, Indiana. She and David were married for 35
years until his death in 2008.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Georgia",serif;letter-spacing:.1pt'>Charlotte was the co-owner and
operator of Bowen Ceramic Tile for more than 35 years. She was a genius with
color, and was widely sought to help design the exact right kitchen, bathroom, or
fireplace. Charlotte poured her expertise into helping clients create their
dream homes for more than 35 years. Each now a small memorial sprinkled
throughout her Lafayette community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Georgia",serif;letter-spacing:.1pt'>Genealogy also held a special
place in Charlotte's heart. She spent years traveling and sifting through dusty
small town archives to uncover generations of family history. For Charlotte,
the thrill of the hunt was a story worthy to be told.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Georgia",serif;letter-spacing:.1pt'>Charlotte was a Girl Scout
leader, a soother of babies, and chief architect for more than a few of her
kids' school projects. Her passion was in helping people see the details and
she would wish for us all to take an extra minute to wrap a pretty package,
lend a sympathetic ear to someone going through a home remodeling project, and
to cheer for Purdue basketball.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Georgia",serif;letter-spacing:.1pt'>Surviving her are children
Angela Potter, of Greenwood, IN, and Kyle Bowen (wife Kelli Robertson Bowen) of
Tempe, AZ and grandchildren Fletcher, Palmer, Hamilton, and Sinclair. Also surviving
are sisters Virginia Ann &quot;Ginger&quot; Kahl (Vern) of Franklin, IN, Karen
Mengle (Rev) of Greenwood, IN, and a brother David James Hixson.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Georgia",serif;letter-spacing:.1pt'>No funeral or memorial service
are immediately planned. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be
made to Badger Grove Community Baptist Church of Brookston, IN.</span></p>
