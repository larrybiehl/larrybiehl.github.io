- Louise Janet Diesslin Burchby passed away on August 9th at the age of 93 at
her home in West Lafayette, surrounded by her family. Louise grew up on a farm
near LaPorte, the youngest of five children. She was both baptised and married
in the same Methodist church, and the church was always a vital part of her
life. She was a dyed-in-the-wool Cubs fan, and later a Boilermaker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia",serif;color:#303030'>Louise's
experience on the family farm, and ten years of 4-H projects, gave her the work
ethic, skills and knowledge that would benefit her all of her life. It also
provided the basis for a full scholarship to Purdue, majoring in home economics
with a minor in botany. In 1946, she caught the eye of a charming,
just-returned soldier named Glen, who followed her to Purdue. Their 64-year marriage
began in 1948 and they graduated in 1950.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia",serif;color:#303030'>After
graduation, Louise found a job teaching home economics at Fowler, IN, while
Glen taught agriculture at Brook. In 1952 they shifted from teaching to dairy
farming, and had the first of their four children. Louise's responsibilities
transitioned to parent and farm manager. She also grew, prepared and preserved
most of the family's food. In 1958 they moved to Snowcrest Farm, near Donovan,
IL. For the next 21 years, Snowcrest was the setting for dairy farming and
child rearing. Louise's blend of curiosity, joy, compassion, and impish good
humor, combined with the daily tasks of farm life, instilled teamwork and self
confidence in her children. Louise did the bookkeeping for the farm--as well as
her share of hands-on farming. She volunteered at school, at church, and in the
community, from Home Extension instructor to election supervisor. She continued
her deep love of the outdoors, whether on the tractor cutting silage, caring
for the animals or tending her massive garden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia",serif;color:#303030'>After thirty
years of farming, Louise and Glen began a new chapter of their lives in Kodak,
TN, in the Smoky Mountains. Louise worked for 10 years as an executive
secretary at Dollywood. It was quite a change from driving tractors or herding cows,
but her quiet competence and diligence proved themselves once more. She and
Glen took every opportunity to travel by ship, plane, train, and a succession
of campers and RVs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;background:white'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Georgia",serif;color:#303030'>In 2009 Louise
and Glen returned to their Hoosier roots, settling in West Lafayette. They
continued volunteer work and became members of St. Andrew United Methodist
Church. Their home became the new focal point for visitors from all over and
they were quickly embraced by their neighbors and church family. Louise will be
greatly missed by all those whose lives she touched. Her love of nature,
welcoming personality, and deep religious faith were true gifts that she shared
generously. She loved the community, and they loved her--she was very happy to
spend her last years here.</span></p>
