<h1>Joyce Lee Combs</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Nov. 29, 1934 to Aug.
5, 1999</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Family:  Joyce was the wife of Edward L. Combs and the
daughter of Thelma and Donald Coash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relationship to St. Andrew:  During her terminal illness
Joyce formed a special bond with St. Andrews pastor, Reverend Tim Burchill. 
She was unable to attend services at St. Andrew but was associated through her
husband’s attendance and supported by the prayers of the congregation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recognitions:  Joyce was a concert pianist being part of a
traveling piano duo team of “Coash and Allen” which performed widely in the
United States.  She also played with the Minneapolis Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial:  A Schaaf Baby Grand Piano that Joyce owned and
played was donated to St. Andrew Church and an organ fund was established which
purchased the Allen Organ now in the Great Room of the new Church.  The Grand
Piano was refurbished by Myron Deckard and used in the Church from the time of
the donation until 2011.  In 2011 the Grand Piano was sold and the funds were
applied to the purchase of the digital piano that was also placed in the Great
Room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About the Piano:  Adam Schaaf patented his piano in May of
1908 in Chicago, Illinois.  The Schaaf baby grand piano in the St. Andrew
sanctuary was built in 1923.  Donald Coash, a Gary steel worker, was able to
purchase this piano in 1943 for his daughter when a Crown Point family learned
of the potential talent of Joyce and agreed to sell the piano to her family on
very favorable terms.  It is all natural wood and was restored to its present
beauty by Myron Deckard, a member of the St. Andrew Congregation, in the fall
of 1999.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Organ: The renaissance Series 3-manual model R-300 Allen
Organ produces the most realistic pipe organ sound available from a pipe less
organ.  The Renaissance 3-manual model along with the MIDI attachment offers
almost limitless versatility and flexibility, assuring sounds that will fit
specific worship styles and tastes.  The console is expertly crafted of solid
walnut and the nine speakers are institutional-quality and designed to emulate
the massive air movements of cathedral pipe organs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The piano and organ were dedicated Oct. 8, 2000 with a
Musical Celebration at St. Andrew United Methodist Church. The musicians were
Jan Coleman, LuAnn Boggess, Ellen Byers, Doris Weis, Lisa Tally and Mary
Warren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joyce Lee Coash was born on Thanksgiving Day, November 29,
1934 to Thelma and Donald Coash of Crown Point, Indiana.  Bedridden for several
months at the age six, she turned to music and became a very accomplished
pianist and later learned to play the organ.  She often substituted for the
pianist or organist at her home church, the First Presbyterian Church of Crown
Point.  An audition for Dr. Rudolph Gantz, president of the Chicago Music
College, resulted in her receiving a scholarship to study under his direction. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following graduation from Crown Point High School in 1952
she attended the Chicago Music College.  While in Chicago she also played in
the Chicago Civic Symphony.  In 1954 she moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota where
she studied organ at the University of Minnesota.  She became a partner in the
piano duo team of “Coash and Allen”, performing all over the United States
until her partner, James Allen suffered a stroke.  Without a partner, Joyce
continued her musical career by playing with a Minneapolis Philharmonic,
teaching at the Minneapolis Conservatory of Music, giving private lessons, and
serving as organist for a church in St. Paul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She enrolled in the Art Education Program at Indiana
University in 1969 and upon graduating from Indiana University in 1969 she
became an art teacher and art department chairman at the Tippecanoe Junior High
School when it opened.  While being interviewed for the position she met Edward
Lee Combs, a member of the interview team.  They were married on December 28,
1969, in Crown Point, Indiana.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the time Joyce was diagnosed with cancer, she was not
affiliated with any church in the Lafayette area.  Through the influence of her
friend, Lorraine Edwards, Pastor Burchill of the St. Andrew United Methodist
Church became her spiritual mentor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Knowing that her illness was terminal, Joyce asked Pastor
Burchill if, although she was not a member of St. Andrew, he would officiate at
her funeral service.  When he agreed, an immense burden was lifted from her
mind.  She was emphatic that she did not want a lot of flowers and instead
requested that contributions made in her memory go to an organ fund at St.
Andrew United Methodist Church.</p>
