<h2>March 3, 1976 to December 23,1999</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relationship to St. Andrew: Ryan was a Member of St. Andrew
where he was confirmed.  He was very active in the Junior and Senior High Youth
Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Family: Ryan was the son of Bob and Cheryl Dexter.  Reverend
Dexter was the Pastor of St. Andrew from 1985 to 1992.  Ryan also had a sister,
Tonya, and brother, Brent, who were extremely supportive of their physically
challenged brother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recognitions:  Birth defects limited Ryan in his physical
ability but did not limit his spirit.  He was a Special Olympic athlete with
many ribbons and medals.  He was a manager of his high school basketball team
and received two letters.  His high school class voted him, “The Most Likely to
be Remembered”.  His high school graduation in 1995 was a very important
achievement for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorials:  A tree has been planted in the front lawn of St.
Andrew in memory of Ryan.  In 2007 two spruce trees and two river birch trees
were planted in front of the new Church to replace trees left at the Meridian
Street location.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.8pt'>Ryan was born to Bob and Cheryl
Dexter in Lafayette, Indiana, on March 3 1976, and died December 23, 1999. In
spite of his limitations resulting from birth defects, Ryan achieved much from
learning to use sign language, talk and even walk with the aid of braces and a
walker to graduating from high school in 1995. His senior class voted him
&quot;Most Likely to be Remembered,' and he is. Ryan is remembered as being a
goal-oriented and strong-willed student, often persevering against seemingly
insurmountable odds. It frequently took him hours to complete an assignment
that his classmates could finish in minutes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:10.3pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:10.05pt'>He is remembered for his love of
sports as both a competitive participant and as an avid fan. He won many
ribbons in Special Olympic events and played every sport he and his brother
could modify for indoor crawling with energy and zeal. He actively supported
numerous teams at his high schools (Lafayette Jefferson and Fort Wayne Snider)
and at West Lafayette High School where his sister, Tonya, and his brother,
Brent, attended. He earned two letters as manager of the Snider boys basketball
team and the respect of the athletes he high-fived and cheered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:10.05pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.8pt'>Ryan is remembered for his sense
of humor. He loved to laugh and to make others laugh with his witty remarks.
Ryan is remembered as a loving, caring family member and friend who inspired
the lives of all who knew him and as a person who had hope even though his
condition didn't. </p>
