<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Loraine was the oldest member of St. Andrew when she
passed away. She had attended regularly since the 1970s and contributed in
different ways over the years. One of her major interests was education and she
worked with the education committee for many years. When she came to Lafayette
to work at Purdue she and her friend, Margaret Stoyer, purchased a home on
Salisbury Street. This allowed them to walk to church as well as to the
University where they both worked. Loraine was a very active member of Marion
Baumgardner’s Sunday morning Bible study class and talked about it often. She
also supported the music program by playing in ensembles. After Loraine retired
from Purdue she volunteered in the church office one day a week to help fold
and collate the bulletins. She continued to do this for over 40 years until the
year before her death. In addition to her office service Lorraine showed her
devotion to SAUMC and the Lafayette community by establishing two funds. The
first was the Good Samaritan fund which provided support for community members
in need without describing these needs. The second was a scholarship fund which
provided student support that added school expenses other than tuition and
books not covered by most scholarships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

Lorraine was teaching at St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN and they established
a joint residence. They stayed together during moves from St Olaf to Berea
College in Kentucky followed by a move Ohio State. Finally they came to Purdue
and West Lafayette where Margaret passed away in 1981.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Loraine grew up in Findlay, Ohio where her father
owned a bakery. She often talked about sitting in the corner of the shop
watching the bakers work and hoping for a cookie, which she received if she was
a good girl. Her parents, Frank and Grace Edwards, and a brother, Carmen H.
Edwards preceded her in death. Her closest living relatives were great nieces
and nephews who lived in Virginia. They kept in touch with her and worked with
Westminster Village to provide good care in her last years. Her St. Andrew
“daughter” was Margie Sharples who visited her regularly and kept her involved
as long as possible.</span></p>

viola and violin and taught music in public schools and in universities. She
played in orchestra and ensembles until she was in her 90s. She was a great
example of how a person can enjoy and share music all of one’s life. Loraine
was also a very hospitable person and enjoyed sharing her home with visiting musicians
and friends.</span></p>
