<P>This a link to the histories that Mom (Martha Jane Biehl) generated during her life time and other memories from her files.</P>
<P><a href="histories.html">Go to Histories and other Memories</a></P>
<P></P>

<P>This set of pictures is dedicated to our folks and what they have done for us during their lifetimes.</P>

<P>You can view the pictures in two different formatted screens
controlled by a drop down list:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>The "with list" mode includes a list of the pictures on the
   left side of the browser window. The scrollable list allows one to
   select a picture and display it directly.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>The "no list" mode does not include the list of pictures. This
   mode was created for use in presentations.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The navigating buttons above a picture allow one to:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>The ^ button allows one to return to this page.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>Go to the first picture: &lt;&lt;; [or use the up arrow key]</LI>
   
   <LI>Go to the previous picture in order: &lt;; [or use the left arrow key]</LI>
   
   <LI>Go to the next picture in order: &gt;; [or use the right arrow key]</LI>
   
   <LI>Go to the last picture &gt;&gt;;  [or use the down arrow key]</LI>
</UL>

<P>The "Small, Medium, Large, Fit to Window, Fit to Window - no caption &amp; Full" drop-down
list allows one to control the size of the picture. &quot;Fit to Window" is the
default picture size.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>"Small" causes a picture of around 300 pixels by 440 pixels to
   be displayed. "Small" is the best size to use on a 15 inch
   monitor.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>"Medium" causes a picture of around 400 pixels by 600 pixels
   to be displayed. "Medium" is a good size to use on a 17 inch
   monitor.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>"Large" causes a picture of around 600 pixels by 900 pixels to
   be displayed. "Large" is a good size to use on a 19 inch
   monitor.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>"Fit to Window" causes a picture to be displayed that fully fills the
   web browser window. Internet Explorer expects the web browser
   window to take the full screen. The results of this vary with the
   web browser be used. Space is allowed below the picture for 3-4
   lines of caption. This was created for presentions.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>"Fit to Window-no caption" causes a picture to be displayed that fully
   fills the web browser window; no caption is displayed. Internet
   Explorer expects the web browser window to take the full screen.
   This was created for presentions.</LI>
   <LI>&quot;Full&quot; causes the picture to be displayed at its full resolution. Most times this will be larger that the screen and one will have to scroll around the image.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The "Slide Show" drop-down list allows one to display the pictures
in order by the selected time interval in seconds. The timer starts
after the current picture has been fully displayed.</P>

<P>Information about the pictures:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Most pictures were scanned at 300 pixels per inch. Small
   pictures were scanned at 600 pixels per inch. Slides were scanned
   at 1200 pixels per inch. Each original picture contains around
   1700 x 1200 pixels and takes up 6 megabytes of disk space. The
   pictures in this presentation represent a jpeg compressed version
   of the original with a compression setting of "75-90".</BLOCKQUOTE>
